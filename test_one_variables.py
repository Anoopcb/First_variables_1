#print() function
## first project, how to print in print function
print("Hello world")
print('Hello world')

#string:-  collection of character inside "Double quotes"
#or 'single quotes'
# you can use 'single quotes' insides "double quotes" and
#double quotes "" inside single quotes '' but you can not use
#double quotes inside double quotes "" same with single quotes

### please see below example
print("Hello 'world' world")
print('Hello "world" world')

#Escape Sequences
#\' single quote
#\" double quote
#\\ backslash
#\n new line
#\t tab
#\b backspace

print('Hello \'world\' world')
print("Hello \"world\" world")
print("Hello World\nHello World")

#Comments, like this, python ignore all these hash comments
#for out put Line A \n Line B
print("Line A \\n Line B")
print("#****print these following lines*****")
print("This is \\\\ double blackslash")
print("this is /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ mountain")
print("\\\" \\n \\t \\\' ")

## if you put r before double quotes or single quotes in print
## function then this will treat escape sequance as a normal test

#####*** VARIABLES finally ******

# varialbe ar just container which can store any data in memory
## or you can say these are agents for a memory allotment
## you can change value in variables
### varibles are immutable

number = 1
print(number)
number= "Anoop"
print(number)

#### variable rule

##### you can't start a variable name by number
#  2number = 44, will give a error

####### second rule

# can be start any letter or _

print(number[0])### we will see these string topic


#### convention

## normally we use snake case writting

### use_one_name

##### useOneName--camel case writting, we should avoid this tye of writting
